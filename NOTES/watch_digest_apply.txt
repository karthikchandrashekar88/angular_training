$scope.$watch will watch over the variables in the current controller scope.

$scope.$digest will invoke the watch for each and every variable in the scope.

If we have nested controllers, and we need to update parent and child scope, we go for $scope.$apply.

2 cases where angular doesn't invoke the digest or apply explicitely:
	1) when events are dynamically generated and it updates the binding of an element.
	2) when 3rd party APIs update the current binding of any elements in that scope.
