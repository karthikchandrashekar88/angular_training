Dependency injection is injection of one instance of a class when that class is dependent on another class.

interface ICreditCard{
}

class Visa : ICreditCard{
}
class Master : ICreditCard{
}

class Shopping{
	public void MakePayment(ICreditCard c){
		//Code to make payment.
	}
}

public static void main(){
	ICreditCard card;
	card = new Visa();
	card = new Master ();
	shop.MakePayment(card);	//This is dependency injection.
}
